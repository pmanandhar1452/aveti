# aveti
A sensor network (to monitor a home garden).

Aveti is a hobby project I created for pedagogical purposes. It illustrates the use of PyQt on a desktop frontend and gRPC on a Raspberry Pi for remote monitoring and watering of plants in a home garden.

The name is inspired by the Sanskrit word *अवेति*, which can mean among other things _to conceive_.
